<h1>About Me</h1>

 My enthusiasm for a career in IT is evident in my dedication to my academic pursuits and my current participation in the IT Professional Year Program, where I 
 improved my soft skills and adjusting to the demands of the Australian workplace. I have proficiency in SQL, Excel, PowerBI along with a solid understanding
  of data cleansing and transformation techniques. I am excited to apply my analytical knowledge while also learning new skills to support business processes and contribute to organizational growth.</p>
